He has a moustache and a forked beard, and his black hair is largely covered by an orange bonnet with a turned-up brim on which there is a gold or silver-gilt pilgrim’s badge of Our Lady of Halle, a town near Brussels that became a place of pilgrimage frequented by the Habsburg rulers of the Low Countries. He is wearing a low-cut, deep red doublet and a simple gown over a white shirt. His brown hose is attached to his doublet with double points, the space between them being filled with the white shirt and the codpiece. He is wearing thin white leather gloves, and his right hand rests on the beautifully worked hilt of a sword. The sword itself is held in an embroidered strap with a leather or velvet bag hanging from it which is decorated with pearls and gold thread with inset floral motifs and has a fleur-de-lis worked into it. The man’s costume was already rather outmoded by the 1520s, with only the short hair and the beard being fashionable at that time. Interestingly, he is not wearing a palrock, a long overgown which would have concealed his hose, the bottom of the white shirt and the codpiece. The fairly simple clothing and the absence of the palrock indicate that the man was not a nobleman but more probably a soldier, while the pilgrim’s badge makes it likely that he was a Christian who moved in the circles around Margaret of Austria (1480-1530) at the Habsburg court in Brussels or Mechelen, or both.","properties":[{"propertyDefinitionUri":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/description","value":"This is the earliest and only individual portrait of a black African to have survived from the late middle ages and the Renaissance.
